# Firebug Lite extension for Chrome
This is an extended version of the old Firebug Lite extension. Should work with newer versions of Chrome. Malware free and with no tracking.

Please enjoy.

You can find and install this extension at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/firebug-lite-for-google-c/ehemiojjcpldeipjhjkepfdaohajpbdo?hl=en). You shouldn't really use it, as the Chrome developer tools (F12) are much better.

If you love it, please [donate to support this extension](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=67TZLSEGYQFFW). Thank you <3
